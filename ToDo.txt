You walk left and right and can go up and little a bit in the screen.
The screen scrolls when you move.
You are in a city and you can walk on a sidewalk of a road.
There are various buildings, probably randomly generated
There are some people walking around
In some specific places you may move to a different road. Maybe with a "metro" station to change it. Or maybe by just going up or down to some intersections.
You start with a very bad shaped human character.
Character cannot do much.
You try to collect all items you can to gain money and improve yourself.
There is trash around the city that can be recycled to get some little money.
There is some money (small amounts) on the roads from time to time.
There can be thiefs or cops that may rob you or arrest you.
Some buildings may offer something to buy
Some buildings may offer some jobs to do
The possible actions may depend on your knowledge, levels, and aspect
The goal (end game) will be to reach a certain objective (random? Like owning a home? Or getting 1 million money?)
Maybe some very simple dialogue system to interact with some NPCs.
You can find or buy things like shoppers, bags, etc. that will allow you to carry more items
